# Tokenized Energy Trading

## 📌 Project Description
Tokenized Energy Trading is a blockchain-based system that represents energy units (kWh) as digital tokens.  
Users can mint their generated energy, store it as on-chain assets, and seamlessly trade it with others in a secure and transparent environment.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a decentralized marketplace for renewable energy where producers and consumers can directly interact,  
eliminating intermediaries and promoting efficient, transparent, and sustainable energy usage.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Energy Tokenization:** Convert generated energy into tradeable blockchain tokens.
- **Peer-to-Peer Trading:** Transfer energy tokens between users securely.
- **Transparent Balances:** Publicly check tokenized energy ownership on-chain.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with real-world smart meters for automatic token minting  
- Dynamic energy pricing based on supply and demand  
- Marketplace for buying/selling energy tokens  
- Token staking for grid stability rewards  
- Cross-chain energy asset transfer through bridges
